# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Getting Started

This project comes with a setup script (`setup.sh`) to simplify the initial setup process. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application.

### Automatic Setup with `setup.sh`

1. **Ensure Prerequisites**:
   - Make sure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) and npm installed.

2. **Run the Setup Script**:
   Execute the following command in the root directory of the project:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   The `setup.sh` script will:
   - Check for Node.js and npm installation.
   - Create a `.env` file if it does not exist.
   - Install the required dependencies.
   - Generate the Prisma client.
   - Run database migrations.
   - Seed the database.
   - Start the development server.

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`).

### Manual Setup (Step-by-Step)

If you prefer to set up the project manually, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory (if it does not exist).
   - Add the following variables to your `.env` file:
     ```env
     AUTH_SECRET="p/wrSvsfu1HMIrQYnwab0F9LMborjQqSyGbq3+X/yv8=" # Generated by create-t3-app
     DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"
     ```

3. **Generate Prisma Client**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Seed the Database**:
   - To seed the database, run the following command:
     ```bash
     npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
     ```

6. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will start, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000` or the next available port.
